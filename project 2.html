        <br/>
        <h2><strong> chapter 1</strong></h2>
        <p>Molly had benn staring out of her window for about an hour now. on her desk, lying the of <em>Nature,New Scientist,</em>and all the other <br/>
        scientific jornals her work had appeared in, was a wall thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road. </cite>it had been molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she <br/>
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. <br/>
    <br/>
She had spent yhe last ten years in this room, sirring under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the reguge of people who have <br/>
nothing better to do</q>. Aithough many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outsatanding achievement, molly <br/>
<i>did</i>think she had something better to do.
